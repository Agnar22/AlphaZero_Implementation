## Other resources
* The [AlphaZero-](https://deepmind.com/documents/260/alphazero_preprint.pdf "AlphaZero paper by D. Silver et al.") and [AphaGo Zero paper](https://deepmind.com/documents/119/agz_unformatted_nature.pdf "AlphaGo Zero paper by D. Silver et al.") are essential to read to achieve a thorough understanding of the algorithm. 
* For a brief walkthrough of the algorithm and a more "hands on approach" I recommend reading through [this article](https://medium.com/oracledevs/lessons-from-implementing-alphazero-7e36e9054191 "Lessons From Implementing AlphaZero") on Medium about an implementation of the AlpaZero algorithm.
* To get a gentle introduction to the algorithm, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ciR6rA85tg "AlphaZero: DeepMind's New Chess AI ") by Two Minute Papers might be a nice place to start.
* David Silver also [explains AlphaZero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wujy7OzvdJk "Deepmind AlphaZero - Mastering Games Without Human Knowledge") himself.
